                                                             Power-Bi-Project-Sales-Dashboard

Prepared a sales dashboard using Power BI which aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for visualizing and analyzing sales data in an organization. 
The project leverages the powerful capabilities of Microsoft Power BI to create an interactive and insightful dashboard that enables users to make data-driven decisions, track sales performance, and identify key trends and opportunities. 
Project Phases:

Step 1- Data Collection:

Identify and gather relevant sales data sources, which may include transaction records, customer information, product details, and regional sales data.
Ensure data quality and consistency through data cleaning and validation processes.

Step 2- Data Transformation:

Use Power Query in Power BI to transform raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
Perform data cleansing, handle missing values, and create calculated columns or measures as needed.
Merge and append tables to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

Step 3- Data Modeling:

Develop a robust data model in Power BI, defining relationships between tables to enable meaningful analysis.
Implement DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures and calculated columns to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales growth, average order value, and conversion rates.

Step 4- Dashboard Design:

Create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly dashboard layout.
Utilize Power BI's drag-and-drop features to add visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps to represent sales data.
Incorporate slicers, filters, and drill-down functionalities to enhance interactivity.

Step 5- Key Visualizations:

Include visualizations like bar charts for sales performance by product or category, line charts for trends over time, and geographical maps for regional analysis.
Implement a key metrics section with cards displaying important KPIs at a glance.
Use tables and matrices to present detailed sales information and allow for easy comparison.

Step 6- Dynamic Filtering:

Implement dynamic filtering options using Power BI's interactive features, allowing users to customize the view based on specific parameters.
Enable cross-filtering and drill-through capabilities to explore data at various levels of granularity.
